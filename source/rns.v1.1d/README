                       R N S  v1.1d

 RNS constructs models of rapidly rotating, relativistic stars. 

 Here is a description of the files you should have:

 1) README : this file
 2) Makefile : Unix makefile
 3) rns.c : ANSI C source code
 4) manual.tex : Latex file of the manual
 5) examples.test : several examples with their output
 6) HnG.c : C program which converts equations of state
	    files to the required format

 You will have to download the equation of state files separately.

 In addition, you may find customized Makefiles for specific platforms, e.g.
 Makefile.alpha (for DEC ALPHA). 

 Before running make, you need to edit the Makefile in order to specify your 
 compiler and compiling options. If a Makefile.platform  exists for your 
 machine, you probably only need to rename Makefile.platform to Makefile and 
 run make. 

 If you need to substantially change the Makefile in order to run it on your
 machine, I would appreciate it if you could send me your Makefile, so I can
 include it in future releases.
  
 For information on how to use the code, please refer to the accompanying manual.
